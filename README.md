This Java Hangman game features Easy, Medium, and Hard levels with predefined word lists. Players select a difficulty, and a word is chosen randomly. Players guess letters, receiving feedback. They have limited guesses and warnings. The game ends with a win message if the word is guessed or a game over message if guesses run out.

This Java code implements a simple Hangman game with three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. The game is designed with a class Hangman that manages the game logic, and a main method in the Hman class that serves as the entry point. The Hangman class contains predefined word lists for each difficulty level, and it randomly selects a word from the appropriate list based on the user's choice. The player is given a certain number of guesses to figure out the hidden word, with the number of guesses being proportional to the length of the word. The game starts by asking the player to choose a difficulty level, which sets the word to be guessed. The player then attempts to guess the word by inputting letters, with the game providing feedback on the correctness of each guess and updating the word display accordingly. If the player guesses a correct letter, it is revealed in the word; otherwise, the number of guesses decreases. The player also has a limited number of warnings for repeated guesses. The game continues until the player either correctly guesses the word or runs out of guesses. If the player wins, a congratulatory message is displayed; if not, a game over message is shown. The art module is used to enhance the visual presentation with decorative text. The game offers an engaging way to practice vocabulary and spelling skills.
